# PytronAI - tron like game with artifical intelligence

This project is a fork of [Pytron](https://github.com/fraka/pytron) by [fraka](https://github.com/fraka).  
It is made by [Hugo Forrat](https://github.com/HugoForrat) and [Thibault Nocchi](https://github.com/Tiwenty) as a project for an AI class at our CS school.

The plan is to make a CPU player behaving in a more intelligent way than (what seems to be) the current naive implementation for the CPUs.  
We will first try with a simple [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) algorithm, or a [Monte Carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search). Then we will maybe try reinforcement learning through [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning).

## Requirements

* Python3
* [Pyglet](https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/wiki/Home)
